> ☕ **Enjoying Nuvio Live Sports?** Consider [supporting the project on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/rajodedara) to help cover server bandwidth, dedicated scrapers, and 24/7 sports streams!

A production-grade live sports streaming add-on for [Nuvio](https://nuvio.tv) and [Stremio](https://www.stremio.com/). It serves as a powerful multi-source aggregator that provides native live sports streams (Football, Basketball, Motorsport, Cricket, and more) inside your client, utilizing an advanced internal stream resolver to bypass CORS restrictions.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **🏟️ Multi-Source Aggregator:** Combines matches and streams from multiple sources (StreamFree, Streamed.pk, BinTV, TimStreams, SportyHunter, NTV, iptv-org) into a unified catalog.
- **⚡ Background Cron Caching:** Uses Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) caching with an internal background Cron Service to ensure instant loading without hammering provider APIs.
- **🛡️ Opossum Circuit Breakers:** Provider requests are isolated via circuit breakers to instantly fail-over if a streaming site goes down.
- **🧠 Algorithmic Stream Scoring:** Prioritizes high-resolution direct `.m3u8` links over external web players.
- **🌐 Built-in Stream Resolver:** Spawns a secondary proxy process (`resolver`) to bypass CORS and referrer restrictions natively.
- **📡 WebRTC P2P Mesh Network:** Integrates P2P sharing in the fallback Web Player (`/watch`) to handle massive concurrent traffic dynamically.
- **⚙️ Dynamic Configuration:** Features a beautiful local configuration page to curate your favorite sports and teams.
- **🏗️ Zero-Code YAML Scrapers:** Add new streaming sources instantly using CSS selectors in YAML.

### ⚙️ How the Addon Works Internally

1. **Catalog Construction & Fuzzy Match Merging**:
   A background cron service periodically queries all active scraping APIs and website providers (e.g., StreamFree, BinTV, Streamed.pk). It normalizes titles/times and uses fuzzy matching algorithms in [`MatchAggregator`](file:///c:/Users/odeda/Desktop/Projects/Nuvio%20Live%20Sports%20Plugin/src/services/MatchAggregator.js) to deduplicate identical fixtures, keeping them in an in-memory SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate) cache.

2. **Stream Retrieval & Obfuscation Decryption**:
   When the user opens a match event in Nuvio/Stremio, the app queries the provider pages to locate where the video is embedded. Since providers obscure their streams, the addon runs automated parsing and decryption rules:
   * **TimStreams XOR Decryption**: In [`TimStreamsProvider.js`](file:///c:/Users/odeda/Desktop/Projects/Nuvio%20Live%20Sports%20Plugin/src/providers/TimStreamsProvider.js), the embed HTML containing a script block in the format `var XXXX=[nums],YYYY=key1,ZZZZ=key2` is parsed. The script is decoded at runtime via `(char_code ^ key1 - key2 + 256) % 256` to construct the true JavaScript string, revealing the hidden `.m3u8` source URL.
   * **StreamFree Token Extraction**: In [`StreamFreeProvider.js`](file:///c:/Users/odeda/Desktop/Projects/Nuvio%20Live%20Sports%20Plugin/src/providers/StreamFreeProvider.js), security tokens are regex-extracted from Javascript object configurations (`const _0x = {...};`). These tokens (`_t`, `_e`, `_n`) are then appended as query parameters to authorize access to the CDN stream URL.

3. **CORS and Referrer Bypass (The Proxy Resolver)**:
   CDNs for sport streams usually block external players using `Referer` or `Origin` header validation (returning `403 Forbidden`). To bypass this, the main Express server spawns a local HTTP proxy process ([`resolver`](file:///c:/Users/odeda/Desktop/Projects/Nuvio%20Live%20Sports%20Plugin/resolver/src/server.js)). Instead of returning the raw stream URL directly to the user's player, the app returns a local proxy URL route pointing to this resolver.

4. **Segment Relay**:
   When the video player requests the stream segments (`.ts` chunks) from the resolver:
   * The resolver sends requests to the provider CDN using spoofed headers (attaching fake referrer and origin headers corresponding to the provider's host).
   * It intercepts the incoming payload and pipes the clean video chunks directly to the player in real-time, bypassing any client-side CORS policies.

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

Through the local `/configure` UI, you can append a base64/URI-encoded configuration object to the addon URL:
- **sports:** Comma-separated list of enabled sports categories (e.g., `football,basketball,cricket`). Defaults to `all`.
- **teams:** Comma-separated list of favorite teams (e.g., `Arsenal,Lakers`). These populate the "⭐ Your Teams" catalog.

## ⚙️ Available Scripts

The following npm scripts are defined in `package.json`:

| `npm start` | Runs the compiled bundle in production (`node dist/index.js`). |
| `npm run dev` | Runs the addon server in watch mode with native live reload. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles the server codebase into a single minified bundle inside `/dist`. |
| `npm test` | Runs the test suite via Jest. |
| `npm run generate:provider` | Runs scaffold utility script to generate a boilerplate YAML provider. |
| `npm run check-sources` | Evaluates the live availability of the external scraper provider APIs. |

## 🧪 Testing

The project uses **Jest** for unit and integration testing.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```

## ☁️ Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Render.com (Recommended for One-Click)
This project is configured for deployment on Render.com using the `render.yaml` blueprint.
1. Push your repository to GitHub.
2. Link your repo to Render and create a new **Web Service**.
3. Render automatically sets up the environment and launches both the Express server and the child resolver process.
